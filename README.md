# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Level 1: Basic Visualization
* Used USGS GeoJSON Feed (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) for this activity. 
* Created a map using leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes that have ove 1.0 magnitude based on their longitude and latitude.
* Used cirlces with various sizes and colors to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and darker in color.
* Popups are addded to each earchquake (circle markers) makrer to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* A legend is created to provide the context for the map data.
